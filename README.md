# google-homepage

For my first Odin Project build, I created a nonfunctional clone of the Google homepage using the
HTML and CSS skills I've learned so far. I started not knowing how to code at all, so it took me 
a long time (days) to orient everything properly and get buttons, links, icons, and the form to behave properly. 

I ended up using CSS Flex for the header, main section, and footer after failed attemps with grid--turns out, it 
was ALL in the directions for the project, had I read more carefully. In fact, 80% of the time I spent stumbling 
through things could have been avoided had I carefully gone over the short list of things to "try before starting" 
and reading the directions through to the end before getting started. I would've seen that the searchbar should 
be a form instead of an input and that links in the header and footer should be divided as lists. 

I'm glad now that I rushed into it because I learned so much about other functions that weren't really part of
the scope of the project, but man, it was pretty frustrating at times.
